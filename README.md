Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ä°rem, a freshman studying electrical and electronic engineering at Ankara University. I am excited to have recently started my journey in coding and am currently working on an unmanned aerial vehicle project with the FÄ°ZGET community to participate in competitions. I am also working part-time to gain experience in entrepreneurship and perks at the technocity of Dokuz EylÃ¼l University.

Since starting to learn C a month ago, I have been dedicating a significant amount of my time to mastering the language and building projects. I am excited to be able to share my progress and the codes I have written on my GitHub profile, along with the projects I have created during my learning phase. I believe that coding is a powerful tool that can be used to make a positive impact in the world and I am eager to contribute to this field.

I look forward to connecting with other developers and learning from the community on GitHub. Thank you for visiting my profile.
